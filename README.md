# Multi-Mood-Classifier: Multi-Label Emotion Classification

## Project Goal
This project establishes a benchmark for **Multi-Label Emotion Classification** on the GoEmotions dataset (28 distinct emotion categories). The primary objective was to compare the performance of three progressively complex models—all trained **from scratch**—to determine the optimal architecture for decoding complex human sentiment in text.
